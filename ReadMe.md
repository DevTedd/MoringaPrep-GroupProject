## Description


## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING	
The act of committing a crime has led to many being thrown behind bars. Crime is basically the act of committing an offence that is punishable by law. Crime is everywhere, and that does not make Boston an exception. Despite this being the ‘to-go-to’ city when it comes to the rich culture and historic sites,the likes of Faneuil Hall, it has not fallen short of being in the papers and news for the high rates of crime.
 It is estimated, in every 100,000 people, 3,000 are attacked or they are victims of crime. 
 
 There have been reports in the past where Bostonians have had to give up their walks at night, meet-ups with friends or any social activity due to the sprawling of dead bodies in allies, crimes that may have gone unsolved for over 10 years. An injustice for their families and the dead. 
Others have had to secure their homes with double locks due to crimes like rape, forced entry or robbery. This is but to mention a few. 

On the bright side, there are towns which are way worse than Boston, the likes of Detroit and Memphis.
 People have lived in fear for their lives, but the government is taking initiative to make the city a better place.
